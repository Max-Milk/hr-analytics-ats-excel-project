# üìä HR Analytics ATS Excel Project

Welcome to `hr-analytics-ats-excel-project` ‚Äî a hands-on case study that simulates an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** using Microsoft Excel. This project not only demonstrates my skills in **HR analytics**, **Excel modeling**, and **data storytelling**, but also reflects my understanding of the **recruitment process** and key hiring metrics.

While **AI-powered ATS platforms** are becoming the industry standard, Excel-based systems can still be highly effective for **small to mid-sized companies**, especially during early growth stages. This project explores how Excel can be leveraged for **candidate tracking, data-driven hiring decisions, and sourcing analysis** ‚Äî without costly platforms.
